    <p>Peter Gene Hernandez (born October 8, 1985), known professionally as Bruno Mars, is an American singer-songwriter and
    record producer. He is known for his stage performances, retro showmanship, and for performing in a wide range of
    musical styles, including pop, R&B, funk, soul, reggae, disco, and rock. Mars is accompanied by his band, the Hooligans,
    who play a variety of instruments, such as electric guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, drums, and horns, and also serve as
    backup singers and dancers.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Mars moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career. Following a brief
    contract with Motown Records, he first established his name in the music industry as a songwriter. In 2009, he
    co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons, responsible for various successful singles for Mars himself and other
    artists. He rose to fame as a solo artist in 2010 buoyed by the success of "Nothin' on You" by B.o.B and "Billionaire"
    by Travie McCoy, both of which featured his vocals. In the same year, Mars released his debut studio album Doo-Wops &
    Hooligans, which blended pop with reggae and R&B. It spawned the international number-one singles "Just the Way You
    Are", "Grenade", and "The Lazy Song". Drawing inspiration from disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul genres, his second
    studio album, Unorthodox Jukebox (2012), was his first number one on the Billboard 200. It amassed two Billboard Hot 100
    number-one songs, "Locked Out of Heaven" and "When I Was Your Man".</p>
